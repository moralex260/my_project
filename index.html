            <h2>about me</h2>

            I was born in Lviv in 1978 in Ukraine. In 1994 I graduated from the school with the best result and entered the Lviv National University of Veterinary Medicine and Biotechnology, which successfully graduated in 1999 with a diploma with honors. After that
            I was engaged in many businesses. Finally, in the fall of 2017, I began to visit the html, css, javascript course foundations. I hope to become the developer. This site is my first steps in this direction.
